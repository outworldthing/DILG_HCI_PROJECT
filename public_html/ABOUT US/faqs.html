                    The following are the steps in establishing a sisterhood or twinning relationship:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li> The LGU shall create a Sisterhood or Twinning Committee (SC) which represents a true cross-section of the community, such as: educational, cultural, technical, business, professional, social, women's clubs, civic, veteran,
                      religious,
                      youth, media, etc. </li><br>
                    <li> The SC will discuss the affiliation idea and will determine the choice of city to affiliate based on mutual interests, such as: economic, cultural, social, political, historical ties, etc. </li><br>
                    <li> Before deciding on the choice of city/town, the SC will prepare background information of the LGU: outline the type of business activities carried on; the extent of public and private school system; cultural institutions;
                      occupations
                      and hobbies of community members and the type of projects the community is ready to undertake the beginning. At this point, the LGU may consult the Bureau of Local Government Supervision (BLGS) Secretariat for advice of specific
                      countries and experiences other cities have had to help guide you choice. </li><br>
                    <li> The SC will submit the affiliation proposal to the local government for endorsement by the Governor/Mayor and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan/Panlungsod/Bayan, as the case may be, to the Governor/Mayor of selected city/town.
                      Copy of the
                      proposal will be sent to the Secretariat, BLGS. </li><br>
                    <li> As soon as the LGU decides to proceed with the program, the SC will appoint an Executive Committee (EC) that will have a continuing responsibility for carrying out the program. The Governor/Mayor will serve as the Honorary
                      Chairman
                      of the Executive Committee.</li><br>
                    <li> Under the EC, sub-committees shall be created which is responsible for year-round planning. It may be suggested that a city/town should work through 4 or 5 committees depending on the scope of their program. The work should
                      be
                      divided and spread out so that a large number of people from many sectors of the community should take part to ensure a dynamic and continuous program. </li> <br>
                    <li> Once a twinning has been agreed, it is usual to hold a "Twinning Ceremony" in both communities to enable as many people as possible to be involved at the beginning of the relationship.</li>

                    The Local Governance Support Program for Local Economic Development (LGSP-LED) is an 8-year collaborative project of
                    the Governments of Canada and the Philippines that will support the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)
                    and other relevant national agencies in creating enabling conditions for decentralization and improving policies, laws,
                    programs and operations to enhance local governance and economic development.<br><br>

                    The goal of the project is to foster efficient, responsive, transparent and accountable governance at all levels.
                    Its purpose is to reduce poverty by strengthening local governance and supporting sustainable Local Economic Development (LED).
                    The Program operates both at the national and local levels, providing a better enabling environment for LGUs and improved prospects
                    for local economic development in various communities.

                    At the national level, LGSP-LED will improve the enabling environment for decentralization and local governance, with a focus on how this supports local economic development. It will also address ways to improve the coordination
                    and rationalization of LED approaches in the country.<br><br>

                    On the other hand, LGSP-LED's work at the local level will provide support to participating LGUs in developing and implementing their local economic development approaches. The intention is to build the capacity of LGUs to pursue
                    innovative LED methods that can produce important job creation, generate economic results for women and men, and improve the governance environment support for economic development.<br><br>

                    The strong public-private partnership that would emerge under the Project will provide LGUs and their alliances the means to adopt area-wide, long-term integrated LED strategies focused on creative and sustainable solutions in
                    response to local circumstances.

                    The focus of LGSP-LED assistance is to improve the capacity of the selected LGUs to create and maintain an environment that sustains more value creation
                    for its enterprises and greater prosperity for its people. Sustainable local economic development dictates that the LGU makes efficient use of
                    its natural resources, minimizing adverse effects brought about by undirected growth. The important contribution of the project is ensuring
                    that LGUs have the prerequisite enabling environment in pushing its businesses and residents oriented towards pro-poor, gender responsive and
                    environmentally sound local economic development.

                    In 2008, a DILG Project Management Team (PMT) was created. The PMT facilitated the conduct of a series of consultative meetings and workshops with LED practitioners
                    and partners form other NGAs, the private sector, NGOs, the academe and the donor community to conduct an inventory of existing programs, projects and
                    activities and series that supports local economic development and the development of the logical framework and project implementation plan for LGSP-LED.
                    To date, through a competitive process, four LGU alliances were selected for Phase I: The Province of Guimaras Agri-Tourism Alliance,
                    the Dapitan-Dipolog-Polanco-Katipunan-Pres. M. Roxas-Manukan (DDPKaRoMa) Growth Corridor in the Province of Zamboanga del Norte, One Pangasinan
                    Alliance of LGUs (OPAL) in the Province of Pangasinan, and the Province of Bohol Integrated Area Development Cluster V (BIAD).
                    A series of capacity development workshops and consultative dialogues with the participating LGU alliances in the planning and implementation of
                    priority LED initiatives have also been completed. In June, LGSP-LED intends to hold national and provincial launches. During the national launching,
                    the MOA between DILG, the CEA and the four participating LGU alliances will be signed.

                    The selection of LGU alliances to be covered during Phase 1 will be undertaken in a competitive
                    manner and will be open to all LGUs including provinces and LGU alliances. The call for LGU
                    participation will be disseminated through the DILG regional and field offices nationwide. The LGU
                    application and review of LGU submissions follows a logical sequence involving procedural steps to ensure objectivity and transparency in the LGU selection process.<br><br>

                    Over the 8-year period, LGSP-LED assistance will be implemented in three distinct phases. Phase 1 will involve working with competitive LGUs,
                    Phase 2 will involve working with LGUs in a state of reading for LED, and Phase 3 will involve complementation and leveraging donor resources
                    for LGU LED sustainability.

                  <p><span style="font-weight:600;">Answer:</span>
                    Competitive LGUs are those that have advanced the LED process and would require additional support to further enabling environment
                    for LED. They are targets of Phase 1, which will cover initial 15 months (2008-2010). It will focus on strengthening the LED programming
                    and partnership arrangements of selected four (4) eligible LGU alliances.<br><br>

                    The lessons learned and experience gained during this Phase will serve to guide the succeeding phases of LGSP-LED implementation.
                    It is also intended to inform CIDA and DILG on whether the LGUs should continue into the longer term phase and/or attract more LGUs
                    into the Project.

                    LGUs that are in the state of readiness for LED are those that have demonstrated commitment to pursue a transparent and
                    accountable process of LED and possess the technical, managerial, and financial capacity to accomplish their development goals.
                    They are the targets of Phase 2, which will run for the following subsequent three (3) years (2010-2013). Under this Phase,
                    8 LGUs will be selected for assistance. Separate selection guidelines will be established for Category 2 LGUs based on lessons learned in Phase 1.

                    Phase 3 will run for another three (3) years (2013-2016) and may involve expanding coverage of LGSP-LED programming by DILG to other
                    LGUs through complementation and leveraging with other donors and financial institutions. In this stage, LGUs are able to secure complementary
                    investment support and funding assistance for their LED initiatives The Project will support the capacity of LGUs to develop innovative LED
                    approaches at the local level that would generate jobs and create employment opportunities, improve the governance through local enabling
                    environment supporting local economic development and provide models of emerging best practices that other LGUs would adopt and/or replicate.
